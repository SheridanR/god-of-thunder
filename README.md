God of Thunder (1993, DOS) open-source release

The goal of this project is to port this classic 16-bit DOS game to modern operating systems.

From Ron Davis's original source release on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/god-of-thunder-1994-dos-game/):

```
This is the source code for the 1994 DOS shareware game God of Thunder (Turbo C/Assembler).

It is a good example of how not to code in C. I was once told it was impressive that it
actually worked, so that's something.

This is only the main source code here. I have released it to the public domain. Do whatever
you want with it. It will not compile as-is. There is at least 1 3rd party compression file
missing and the sound/music code was a licensed library that is not open source. The
opening/high score/game select screens are also not included. I have had requests to release
the source, so here it is.

Unfortunately, the source for the sprite editor, level editor and resource packer are apparently
lost to the unreliability of floppy disks.

The game itself can be found for free on Steam. The assets of the game are not open source.
Contact me if you wish to use them in any commercial projects because there are some restrictions.

Sorry, but I cannot offer any support.

Features

* Very questionable C code (to put it nicely)
